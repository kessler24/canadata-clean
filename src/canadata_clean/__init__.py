"""
A collection of utility functions for cleaning and validating Canada-specific structured data
in pandas DataFrames. This package helps standardize common Canadian data fields, including
phone numbers, postal codes, location names (cities and provinces), and dates, while identifying
invalid or problematic entries.

Functions in this package ensure data consistency by:
- Formatting and validating phone numbers and postal codes according to Canadian standards.
- Normalizing city and province names for consistent analysis.
- Checking dates or dates of birth against Canadian date formats.
- Highlighting invalid entries with warnings or exceptions, allowing workflows to continue
  without interruption.

This package is intended to make datasets analysis-ready while helping users identify and
correct data quality issues in Canadian datasets.
